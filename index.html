                <p>My Dearest Bukky,</p>
                <p>Words alone can't express the feelings that have been growing in my heart. You are the most extraordinary soul I've ever known. Your energy, hidden behind that introverted exterior, has always fascinated me.</p>
                <p>Your brilliance, humor, and the way you unknowingly radiate cuteness have captured my heart. I find myself drawn to you in ways I can't explain.</p>
                <p> I have these profound feelings for you, is what I'd have said if we were in Bridgeton so scrap that.</p>
                <h2>Attempt 2</h2>
                <p>Hey Bukky,</p>
                <p>So, I've got this confession to make. I've got a big ol' crush on you. You're the quirkiest introvert I've ever met, and it's pretty adorable.</p>
                <p>You're smart, funny, and have this unintentional charm that's just too hard to resist. </p>
                <p>But here's the twist, I'm not really up for anything serious or a typical relationship. I just wanted to put it out there and see where it goes. So, how about we grab lunch sometime or do you want to see what attempt 3 sounds like?</p>
