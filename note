                <h2>Hey there, Bookie!</h2>
                <p>Before we dive into it, let's start with a fun fact: Did you know that we met on the 18th of January 2022? I'm pretty good with dates and numbers, but what's truly unforgettable is you.</p>
                <p>You're incredibly smart, funny, and your unintentional cuteness is beyond words. Your love for Jujutsu Kaisen, Lana Del Rey, and those adorable kitties is something special.</p>
                <p>But hold up, it's not what you might think. I just need to share something important with you. I want you to know that I'm not looking for a relationship right now. Just sharing my feelings with you, no pressure.</p>
                <p>Now, let's keep the mood light and fun. I have some questions Pete Davidson-style to ask you. Ready for the challenge?</p>

                <h2>Lunch?</h2>
                <p>Question 4: How about we have lunch sometime? If you're up for it, let me know your preferred date and time.</p>
                <button id="lunchYes">Yes, I'd love to!</button>
